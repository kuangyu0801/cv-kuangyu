### SDN-4: Publish-Subscribe Service for Software-Defined Network, Java, REST API, HTTP
- Developed a "Subscriber" Java application which can subscribe to publishing service via REST API and receive UDP datagram from publisher.
- Developed a publishing service, which can receive subscription via HTTP request (GET, POST,  DELETE) and perform content-based routing in OpenFlow network. 


- Follow-up: GitHub reformat
- Jakson parser

### SDN-3: Dynamic Routing for Software-Defined Network, Java, TCP, Dijkstra
- Developed a Java module in Floodlight controller, which provides two dynamic routing modes in OpenFlow network.
- Reactive mode routes with shortest path. Adaptive mode routes TCP flow with load balancing by querying network traffic statistics dynamically and routing in network and transport layer. The implementation is based on Dijkstra's algorithm.
- The Adaptive routing achieves up to 6 times bandwidth increase (582kbs vs 3478kbs) verified with Iperf tool in a MiniNet virtual network on Linux. 

- Developed a Java module, which provides dynamic routing in OpenFlow network. The module is a component in Floodlight controller and contains two modes: Reactive and Adaptive.
- Other keyword: 
Path Selection, maximize bandwidth utilization

### MC-4: Java Application for Wireless Ad-hoc Network Communication, Java, UDP, Raspberry Pi
- Developed 4 Java server and client applications which implement 2 protocols: Flooding and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR). 
- Uses DatagramSocket classes from java.net package for UDP transmission.
- Flooding achieves high robustness with UDP messages broadcast.
- DSR achieves reduced data transfer overhead with route discovery in control messages: Route Request (RREQ) and Route Reply (RREP).
- Deployed and verified applications on Raspberry Pi with real mesh 802.11 WiFi network. 
Java Socket programming


### Android App for City Temperature with Google Firebase
- Developed an Android application, which can update, subscribe, and calculate daily avearge of designated city temperature
- Implemented functions for accessing and querrying shared data in Readtime NoSQL database in JSON format with Google Firebase API

### ATP Tennis Player Network Analysis
- Developed Python programs to build tennis player network and derive structural insights such as Page Rank, Connectivity and Clustering.
- Implemented alogorithms with NetworkX package and built an undirectied graph by processing real tennis match statics in csv format.
- Visualized and rendered network topology with open-source software Gephi
of tennis match statics.

# My Days at G

## 2022 

Role: SWE
Team: Modem System Software, Pixel Mobile Wireless, Device and Services (PA)
### Goal
- Develop GeMS framework
  - Implement wrapper APIs for ShannnonOS by extending extisting pigweed moduels. Theses moduelsare necessary for  GMestris features in modem. Add unit and integration tests for every implemented module.
  - Assist GeMS tram members to establish user-friendly dev env (build, debug, unit test, infra , IDE config)
 config static analysiss derive design insight from GeMS module deve and contribute these insigths to pigweed upstram for other emmbed  project benefit
- Rampup to MSS Developer from Noggler
  - Become fluent and competen in Android workflow and tolls for independent t modem development by flooing the codelabs tutorial. The tools include version control (repo git gerrit) build system android build server, Forrest, adb) test infra treehugger and release.
- Contribute to SWE Interview process

### Review

- Delivery:
  - Designed and Implemented 2 GeMS primitives: Memory (P0) and Queue (P1) by investigating ShannonOS and QURT API, gathering use cases and designing feedback, and taking design reviews.
  - Implemented 3 Pigweed primitive backends: SystemTimer, ThreadNotificationa Assertion on ShannonOS.
  - Facilitated GeMS infra to follow Google SW core practices by 1) configuring static analysis(clang-tidy), formatting(clang-format), and license check(addlicenses) in presubmit checks to improve code quality and readability and 2) developing a Plugweed plugin for automatic API reference Doc generation (Doxygen)
  - Been familiar with modem debugging by identifying MMU Stack Virtualization as the root cause of system timer crashes. Been able to do experiments and bisection codes, analyze ram dumps, discuss with TLs and pigweed experts, and document the details.
  - Quickly ramp up from onboard Improved C++ language skills and software design patterns while developing GeMS project.

- Teamwork Attributes
  - Supported GeMS users by quickly responding to their queries, debugging their issues during dev, and documenting the question and issues on YAQS and GeMS chat room
  - Qualified for interviews. Finished interviewer training and conducted a shadow interview of an L4 SWE
  - Provided valuable feedback on GeMS feature design
